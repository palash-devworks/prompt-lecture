# LLM Fundamentals for AI Advocates
*Technical Knowledge for Business Impact*

Understanding these core concepts enables you to confidently discuss AI capabilities, limitations, and business value with technical teams, customers, and stakeholders. Each term includes the technical foundation plus practical context for advocacy conversations.

## Basic Building Blocks

### **Tokens**
**Technical Definition**: Discrete units of text (words, subwords, punctuation) that language models process. Models tokenize input text and generate output token by token.  
**Business Impact**: Direct cost driver - most AI services charge per token. Affects both expense predictability and response speed.  
**Common Questions**:
- *"How many tokens is typical?"* → Most conversations: 100-500 tokens, complex tasks: 1000+
- *"Can we optimize costs?"* → Yes, through prompt engineering and response formatting

### **Context Window**
**Technical Definition**: The maximum number of tokens an AI model can process in a single interaction, including both input and output.  
**Business Impact**: Determines conversation length and complexity. Larger windows enable richer interactions but cost more.  
**Common Questions**:
- *"What happens when we exceed it?"* → AI loses track of earlier conversation parts
- *"How big is typical?"* → Current models: 4K-128K tokens (roughly 3-300 pages of text)

### **Embeddings**
**Technical Definition**: High-dimensional numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning and relationships.  
**Business Impact**: Enables semantic search, content recommendations, and similarity analysis without exact keyword matching.  
**Common Questions**:
- *"How is this different from keyword search?"* → Finds conceptually similar content, not just exact word matches
- *"What can we build with embeddings?"* → Smart search, content clustering, recommendation engines, duplicate detection

## Core Interaction Model

### **Prompts**
**Technical Definition**: Input instructions and context provided to AI models to guide their response generation.  
**Business Impact**: Quality directly affects output reliability and usefulness. Well-crafted prompts reduce need for multiple attempts.  
**Common Questions**:
- *"How specific should prompts be?"* → More specific generally yields better results, but balance with flexibility
- *"Can prompts be reused?"* → Yes, templates work well for consistent business processes

### **Completions**
**Technical Definition**: Generated text output from AI models in response to prompts. Can range from single words to lengthy documents.  
**Business Impact**: The actual deliverable - quality here determines user satisfaction and business value.  
**Common Questions**:
- *"How do we ensure quality?"* → Prompt engineering, testing, and sometimes multiple generations with selection
- *"Can we control length?"* → Yes, through prompt instructions and API parameters

### **Temperature/Parameters**
**Technical Definition**: Configuration settings that control randomness and creativity in AI outputs, affecting consistency vs. novelty.  
**Business Impact**: Critical for production reliability - low temperature for consistent results, higher for creative applications.  
**Common Questions**:
- *"What temperature should we use?"* → 0.1-0.3 for factual/code tasks, 0.7-1.0 for creative content
- *"Can we change this per request?"* → Yes, most APIs allow per-call parameter adjustment

## Model Fundamentals

### **Training**
**Technical Definition**: Process of exposing AI models to large datasets so they learn patterns and relationships in data.  
**Business Impact**: Determines model capabilities, knowledge cutoffs, and inherent biases. Foundation for all model behavior.  
**Common Questions**:
- *"Can we retrain models ourselves?"* → Extremely expensive; most businesses use pre-trained models
- *"How current is training data?"* → Varies by model, typically has knowledge cutoff dates

### **Inference**
**Technical Definition**: The process of running a trained model to generate responses from new prompts in real-time.  
**Business Impact**: What you pay for with each API call. Affects response speed, scalability, and operational costs.  
**Common Questions**:
- *"Why is inference faster than training?"* → Model weights are fixed; it's just applying learned patterns
- *"How do we optimize inference costs?"* → Batch requests, choose appropriate model sizes, cache common responses

## Advanced Applications

### **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
**Technical Definition**: Architecture combining information retrieval with text generation, allowing AI to access external knowledge sources.  
**Business Impact**: Enables AI to work with your specific data, documents, and real-time information without retraining.  
**Common Questions**:
- *"How does it access our data?"* → Searches indexed documents/databases, then incorporates findings into responses
- *"Is our data secure?"* → Depends on implementation; data can stay within your infrastructure

### **Agents**
**Technical Definition**: AI systems that can use tools, make decisions, and execute multi-step workflows autonomously to achieve goals.  
**Business Impact**: Automates complex processes beyond simple Q&A - can handle entire workflows from research to execution.  
**Common Questions**:
- *"What's the difference from regular AI?"* → Agents can take actions, use tools, and plan multi-step approaches
- *"How do we control what they do?"* → Through careful goal setting, tool restrictions, and approval workflows

### **Fine-tuning**
**Technical Definition**: Additional training of pre-existing models using domain-specific datasets to improve performance on particular tasks.  
**Business Impact**: Creates AI that understands your specific terminology, processes, and requirements better than general models.  
**Common Questions**:
- *"When should we fine-tune vs. use prompts?"* → Fine-tune for consistent, high-volume specialized tasks
- *"How much data do we need?"* → Typically hundreds to thousands of examples, depending on complexity

## Production Considerations

### **Guardrails**
**Technical Definition**: Safety mechanisms and constraints that prevent AI systems from generating harmful, inappropriate, or off-topic content.  
**Business Impact**: Essential for production deployment - protects brand reputation and ensures compliance with policies.  
**Common Questions**:
- *"What happens if guardrails trigger?"* → System refuses request or provides alternative response
- *"Can we customize guardrails?"* → Yes, most platforms allow business-specific safety rules

## Handling Common Questions

Understanding these fundamentals enables confident discussions about AI capabilities and limitations. Here's how to address typical concerns:

### **"Is AI ready for production use?"**
Focus on specific use cases rather than general statements. RAG systems for internal knowledge, embeddings for search, and well-prompted completions for content generation are proven in production. Agents and fine-tuning require more careful implementation.

### **"How do we control AI behavior?"**
Explain the layered approach: guardrails for safety boundaries, temperature for consistency control, prompt engineering for task guidance, and RAG for knowledge scope. It's not about perfect control but predictable boundaries.

### **"What about costs?"**
Token-based pricing makes costs predictable and scalable. Start with clear use cases, optimize prompts, and monitor usage. Most production applications find AI costs comparable to other SaaS tools when properly managed.

### **"Will AI replace our team?"**
Position AI as augmentation, not replacement. These tools handle routine tasks, generate first drafts, and provide research assistance - freeing teams for higher-value strategic work. The companies succeeding are those that embrace AI as a productivity multiplier.

### **"How do we get started?"**
Begin with low-risk, high-value applications like document search (RAG), content generation (prompts/completions), or data analysis (embeddings). Build confidence with proven use cases before exploring advanced applications like agents or fine-tuning.
